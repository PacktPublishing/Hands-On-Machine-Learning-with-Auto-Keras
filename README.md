# Hands-On Machine Learning with Auto-Keras [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Machine Learning with Auto-Keras [Video]]( https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-machine-learning-with-auto-keras-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github) . It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course	
If you want to build efficient models using the open-source Auto-Keras library, then this course is perfect for you. It will teach you how to use Auto-Keras to build custom machine learning and AI models effectively, even with limited machine Learning knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
You will learn how to train a network automatically and evaluate it using Auto-Keras. You will begin by installing Auto-Keras and using it to implement basic algorithms. You will then train more advanced models as you progress to state-of-the-art techniques. <br/>
<br/>
By the end of the course, you will be confident about using Auto-Keras to build custom machine learning models for your organization. <br/>
<br/>

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
This course will help developers with limited data science or machine learning expertise train high-quality machine learning models by using the Auto-Keras open-source library. This course will also benefit experienced ML engineers and data scientists who want to use Auto-Keras to build efficient models that provide accurate results. No prior knowledge of Auto-Keras is required.
A basic knowledge of Python and Keras will be beneficial but isn't mandatory.
